<h1> JASON SCHNEIDERMAN </h1>
<h2> PERSONAL BIO </h2>
<p>I am a Sophomore at Tufts University with interests in finance, computer science, writing, aesthetics
and professional sports. I enjoy solving problems, whether a difficult programming algorithm, design question,
or a not-so-simple math problem, largely because I genuinely love the feeling of successful completion and hate losing in any capacity. 
Each interest (sports not included) tailors to my analytical abilities, strong work ethic, attention to detail, and systematic approach to analyzing and 
evaluating information.
</p>
<p>I like to stay active. I co-captained my high school varsity baseball team, devoting
much of my early life to athletics. Wanting to stay close to sports in college, I decided to write for the Tufts Daily, 
covering both Tufts athletics and professional sports as a reporter and as a weekly columnist.
In my free time, I enjoy reading, exercising, and getting up way too early to watch soccer on weekends.
