1. All required aspects of the assignment were implemented. My additional implementations were adding a
   timer that lasts 60 seconds, sound when frogger hops, dies, and levels up, and level progression in
   which the car speeds, log speeds, and number of logs change as levels increase.
2. Worked with Karthic Aragam and Neena Kapur
3. Worked for approximately 11 hours on assignment.
