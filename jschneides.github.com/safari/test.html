	<p>Nike, originally known as Blue Ribbon Sports (BRS), was founded by University of Oregon track athlete 
Philip Knight and his coach Bill Bowerman in January 1964. The company initially operated as a distributor 
for Japanese shoe maker Onitsuka Tiger (now ASICS), making most sales at track meets out of Knight's automobile.[6]</p>
	<p>According to Otis Davis, a student athlete whom Bowerman coached at the University of Oregon, who later went 
on to win two gold medals at the 1960 Summer Olympics, Bowerman made the first pair of Nike shoes for him, 
contradicting a claim that they were made for Phil Knight. Says Davis, "I told Tom Brokaw that I was the first. 
I don't care what all the billionaires say. Bill Bowerman made the first pair of shoes for me. People don't
believe me. In fact, I didn't like the way they felt on my feet. There was no support and they were too tight. 
But I saw Bowerman make them from the waffle iron, and they were mine."[7]</p>
	<p>In 1966, BRS opened its first retail store, located at 3107 Pico Boulevard in Santa Monica, California.
By 1971, the relationship between BRS and Onitsuka Tiger was nearing an end. BRS prepared to launch its 
own line of footwear, which would bear the Swoosh newly designed by Carolyn Davidson.[8] The Swoosh was first 
used by Nike on June 18, 1971, and was registered with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office on January 22, 1974.[9]</p>
	<p>In 1976, the company hired John Brown and Partners, based in Seattle, as its first advertising agency. 
The following year, the agency created the first "brand ad" for Nike, called "There is no finish line," in which 
no Nike product was shown. By 1980, Nike had attained a 50% market share in the U.S. athletic shoe market, and the 
company went public in December of that year.[10]</p>
	<p>Together, Nike and Wieden+Kennedy have created many print and television advertisements, and Wieden+Kennedy 
remains Nike's primary ad agency. It was agency co-founder Dan Wieden who coined the now-famous slogan "Just Do It" 
for a 1988 Nike ad campaign, which was chosen by Advertising Age as one of the top five ad slogans of the 
20th century and enshrined in the Smithsonian Institution.[11] Walt Stack was featured in Nike's first "Just Do It" 
advertisement, which debuted on July 1, 1988.[12] Wieden credits the inspiration for the slogan to "Letâ€™s do it," the 
last words spoken by Gary Gilmore before he was executed.[13]</p>
	<p>Throughout the 1980s, Nike expanded its product line to encompass many sports and regions throughout the world.[14]</p>
